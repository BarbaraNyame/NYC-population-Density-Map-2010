# New York City Population Density Map (2010)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a map visualization of **New York Cityâ€™s population density in 2010**, organized by **Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs)**.

The map was designed using population data from the **New York City Department of City Planning â€” Population Division** and spatial boundary data from **NYC OpenData**.

## ðŸ“Š What are NTAs?
**Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs)** are statistical areas created by the NYC Department of City Planning by grouping adjacent census tracts. They represent commonly recognized neighborhoods for demographic and urban analysis.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Highlights
- Higher population densities observed in **Manhattan** (Upper East Side, Midtown)
- Densely populated clusters in **Brooklyn** (Williamsburg, Flatbush)
- Lower densities across **Staten Island**
- Patterns reflect NYCâ€™s urban development and transportation accessibility
