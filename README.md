# New York City Population Density Map (2010)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes **New York City’s population density in 2010**, organized by **Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs)**.
The map was designed using population data from the **New York City Department of City Planning — Population Division** and spatial boundary data from **NYC OpenData**.

## 📊 Geographic Units
Boundaries follow NYC Planning’s NTAs (see map layout for explanation).

## 📈 Key Visual Highlights

Below are the main patterns you’ll notice on the map, described by shapes and relative positions rather than place names:

- **Darkest core along the central spine**  
  The deepest shades run along the long, narrow island’s central axis, indicating the highest population concentrations.

- **Clusters adjacent to the central landmass edge**  
  Just off that central spine, you see patches of darker tones following the shoreline contour, marking dense pockets close to the main area.

- **Medium-tone zones radiating outward with localized darker blobs**  
  Moving away from the central axis, the fill shifts to medium shades, with smaller dark spots aligned along linear corridors (suggesting transit or major thoroughfares).

- **Mid-tone patches near water outlines on the northern landmass**  
  On the separate landmass to the north, there are visible medium-to-dark areas close to shoreline edges, forming distinct “hotspots.”

- **Light, uniform fill on the detached southwestern island**  
  The standalone island shape in the southwest appears mostly in the palest tones, reflecting much lower density compared to the rest.

- **Overall radial gradient effect**  
  The color ramp transitions from very dark in the central core outward through medium tones to very light, visually illustrating how density tapers away from the city center.

These descriptions guide readers to connect map colors and patterns to the geometry of the area without requiring labeled place names.
